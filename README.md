## Welcome to the "Car Price Prediction - Geely Auto US Market Analysis" project!

### üìå Overview:
#### This project aims to help Geely Auto, a Chinese automobile company, understand the key factors influencing car prices in the US market. By leveraging machine learning and data science techniques, we analyze various car features to build a predictive model that accurately estimates vehicle pricing. The insights will assist Geely Auto in making data-driven decisions for market entry, pricing strategies, and product design.

### üìÇ Dataset:
#### The dataset contains various car features, including:
##### 1. Car characteristics (e.g: Wheel_Base, Length, Width, Height, Curb_Weight)
##### 2. Engine specifications (e.g: Engine_Size, Horsepower, Fuel_Type)
##### 3. Market-related factors (e.g: Brand, Body_Style, Aspiration)

### üìä Key Features Analyzed:
#### 1. Car Identification:
##### car_ID --> Unique identifier for each vehicle
##### CarName -->	Brand and model (e.g., "bmw x5")

#### 2. Safety & Risk
##### symboling --> Insurance risk rating (-3 to +3, where +3 = high risk) |

#### 3. Physical Attributes
##### wheelbase --> Distance between front/rear axles (inches)
##### carlength --> Vehicle length (inches)
##### carwidth --> Vehicle width (inches)
##### carheight --> Vehicle height (inches)
##### curbweight --> Weight without passengers (lbs)
##### doornumber --> Number of doors (2 or 4)

#### 4. Engine & Performance
##### enginetype --> Engine configuration (e.g., "dohc")
##### cylindernumber --> Number of cylinders (e.g., "four")
##### enginesize --> Engine displacement (cubic inches)
##### fuelsystem --> Fuel delivery system (e.g., "mpfi")
##### boreratio --> Cylinder bore ratio
##### stroke --> Piston stroke length (inches)
##### compressionratio --> Engine compression ratio
##### horsepower --> Engine power (HP)
##### peakrpm --> Maximum RPM

#### 5. Fuel Efficiency
##### citympg --> City miles per gallon (fuel economy) 
##### highwaympg --> Highway miles per gallon

#### 6. Categorical Features
##### fueltype --> "gas" or "diesel"
##### aspiration --> "turbo" or "standard"
##### carbody --> Body type (e.g., "sedan", "hatchback")
##### drivewheel --> "fwd", "rwd", or "4wd"
##### enginelocation --> "front" or "rear"

#### 7. Target Variable
##### price --> Manufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price (USD) 

### üîç Methodology:
#### Step 1: Loading Dataset from Kaggle
#### Step 2: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
#### Step 3: Deriving visuals to determine correlation between different features visually (Heatmap, Pie Charts, Box Plots, etc.)
#### Step 4: Data Pre-Processing 
#### Step 5: Encoding Features  
#### Step 6: Obtaining Correlation with Target
#### Step 7: Data Normalization
#### Step 8: Data Splitting
#### Step 9: Model Building
#### Step 10: Training the Model
#### Step 11: Selecting the features with high correlations
