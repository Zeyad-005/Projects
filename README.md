# 🍄 Welcome to "Mushroom Classification - Decision Trees from Scratch" Project (Classification)

## Overview
This project addresses a classification problem using the UCI Mushroom Dataset. The goal is to build a decision tree model from scratch using information gain to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.

## Objectives
- **Data Loading & Inspection**: Load the dataset from the UCI repository and perform initial inspection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Derive visuals to explore feature distributions (bar plots, heatmaps, etc.).
- **Data Pre-Processing & Feature Engineering**: Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
- **Encoding Features**: Encode categorical variables for use in the decision tree.
- **Data Splitting**: Split your dataset randomly for training, validation, and testing with stratification.
- **Model Building & Training**: Implement a decision tree from scratch using entropy and information gain.
- **Tree Pruning**: Implement post-pruning to prevent overfitting (bonus).
- **Tree Visualization**: Create a visual representation of the learned tree (bonus).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Test different max_depth values and analyze performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Report accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Results Analysis**: Compare training vs. validation performance and analyze feature importance.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Mushroom Dataset
