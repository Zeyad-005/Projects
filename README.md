## 📁 Welcome to "Car Price Prediction - Geely Auto US Market Analysis" Project (Regression)

### Overview
This project addresses a regression problem using the **Geely Auto Car Data**. The goal is to build a model that can predict the car price for Geely Auto's strategic entry into the US market.

### Objectives
1.  **Data Loading & Inspection:** Load the dataset from Kaggle and perform initial inspection.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Derive visuals to determine correlation between different features (Heatmap, Pie Charts, Box Plots, etc.).
3.  **Data Pre-Processing & Feature Engineering:** Handle missing values, outliers, and derive new features if necessary.
4.  **Encoding Features & Normalization:** Encode categorical features and scale numerical features.
5.  **Data Splitting:** Split your dataset randomly for training, validation, and testing.
6.  **Model Building & Training:** Apply linear regression and other models. Implement from scratch using matrix operations (normal equation, gradient descent) and compare with Scikit-Learn.
7.  **Regularization:** Apply L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression) and L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression). Try different regularization parameters & plot validation error vs. regularization parameter.
8.  **Feature Selection:** Select the features with high correlations to the target variable.
9.  **Model Evaluation:** Report Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for all models.
10. **Results Analysis:** Add comments on the results and compare between the models.

### Dataset
**Name:** Car Price Prediction (Geely Auto)  
**Source:** [Car Price Prediction Dataset on Kaggle] --> (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction)

**Target Variable:** `price` (Manufacturer’s suggested retail price in USD)
