# 🔴🟡 Welcome to "Connect 4 AI Agent - Minimax Algorithms" Project (Game AI)

## Overview
This project addresses a game AI problem by creating an intelligent Connect 4 agent using search algorithms. The goal is to implement and compare different minimax variants with heuristic evaluation to create a challenging AI opponent.

## Objectives
- **Game Implementation**: Create a complete Connect 4 game with GUI
- **AI Algorithms**: Implement three minimax variants
- **Heuristic Design**: Create sophisticated evaluation functions
- **Tree Visualization**: Display search trees in readable format
- **Performance Analysis**: Compare algorithm efficiency
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Human vs. AI with configurable parameters

## Game Details
- **Board Dimensions**: Width ≥ 7, Height ≥ 6
- **Win Condition**: Connect four discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally
- **Game End**: Play until board is full, winner has more connected fours
- **AI Algorithms**:
  1. Minimax without alpha-beta pruning
  2. Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
  3. Expected Minimax (with probability distribution)
