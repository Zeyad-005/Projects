## 🤖 Welcome to "Mental Health GPT" Project (Conversational AI)

### Overview
This project addresses a natural language processing problem using **conversational data**. The goal is to build an AI-powered mental health assistant that can provide supportive responses to users.

### Objectives
1. **Data Loading & Inspection:** Load the intents.json dataset and perform initial inspection.
2. **Text Pre-processing:** Clean and prepare conversation data for model training.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transform text data into numerical features using techniques like tokenization and embedding.
4. **Model Architecture:** Design and implement the neural network architecture for intent classification and response generation.
5. **Model Training:** Train the conversational AI model using the prepared dataset.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
7. **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
8. **Deployment:** Create an executable interface for real-time user interaction.
9. **Safety & Ethics:** Implement safeguards for responsible AI responses in mental health contexts.
10. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive project documentation and usage guidelines.
