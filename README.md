# 9️⃣ Welcome to "Sudoku Solver - CSP" Project

## Overview
This project addresses a constraint satisfaction problem by implementing arc consistency algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles. The goal is to demonstrate CSP concepts through a complete Sudoku solver with detailed logging and visualization.

## Objectives
- **CSP Formulation**: Model Sudoku as a constraint satisfaction problem
- **Arc Consistency**: Implement AC-3 algorithm from scratch
- **Backtracking Support**: Validate puzzles and generate solvable boards
- **Detailed Logging**: Track every arc revision and domain reduction
- **GUI Implementation**: Interactive Sudoku interface
- **Performance Analysis**: Test with different difficulty levels

## Problem Details
- **Grid Size**: 9×9 Sudoku board
- **Variables**: 81 cells
- **Domains**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- **Constraints**:
  - All-different in each row (9 constraints)
  - All-different in each column (9 constraints)
  - All-different in each 3×3 subgrid (9 constraints)

## Key Steps
1. Sudoku CSP Model Formulation
2. Backtracking Algorithm for Validation and Generation
3. Arc Consistency (AC-3) Implementation
4. Detailed Logging System for Arc Revisions
5. GUI Development with Two Modes
6. Performance Testing with Different Puzzle Difficulties
7. Solution Verification and Analysis

## Implementation Requirements
- ✅ Complete Sudoku game with GUI
- ✅ Two modes: AI solving and user input
- ✅ Arc consistency with detailed logging
- ✅ Backtracking for validation and generation
- ✅ Proper CSP terminology usage
- ✅ Domain reduction visualization
